Bud POW Total Adjusted
=======================

Not all blocks will be mined by POW. The Hybrid period is quite long, and the last 500,000 blocks pay less than the first 500,000 pay.

At a rough guess,  the ratio should not be more **67% POW** / **33% POS**

As such, the **1,225,000,000** POW figure can be reduced by one third., making a total of **820,000,000**.

If it is assumed that **50,000,000** is staked in year-1, over a 10-year period, with compound interest, the figure will climb higher.

However, usually a small proportion of coins are staked over time, with most ending up on exchanges. 

A guess based on experience is that about **400,000,000** maximum will be staked by the end of the Hybrid period.

Paradoxically, this would bring the total coin count at the end of the Hybrid period to about the same as if each block was POW mined, and no blocks POS mined.

In addition, however, there is a **150.000,000** premine, which also needs to be added to the total coin coun count.

Hybrid Timeframe
=======================


Blocks average 6 minutes, so over 1 day (1,140 minutes), 240 blocks should mined by POW or POS.  Over 1 week, 1,680 block should be mined. Over 1 year, 87,360 blocks should be mined. Over 10 years 870,360 should be mined. Somewhere between Year 11 and Year 12 will be the point Bud is full POS.


    
Blocks Mined *        |  Timeframe     |     
 --------  |  --------   
240         |  1 day  | 
1,680      |  1 week    |
7,200      |  1 month    |
43,200      |  6 months    | 
87,360       |  1 year    |
174,720       |  2 years    |
436,800       |  5 years    |
698,880       |  8 years    |
870,360       |  10 years  | 
999,999       |  11 - 12 years    |
